// Hey, actually realized that the last version i sent may suffer from some long-term rating inflation/deflation. It's not a big deal if you are done implementing already, but you may want to fix the part below:

// ELO's K, this affects how fast ratings change.
// Total K for the team, this is divided by teamsize below
double k = 64;

// Update player ratings
updateRatings(game.getWinningPlayers(), k * p / game.getWinningPlayers().size());
updateRatings(game.getLosingPlayers(), -k * p / game.getLosingPlayers().size());
// This change makes sure that the average of all ratings remains at constant 1600, I overlooked that in the initial version - usually teams are the same size 

// Some notes on the choice of K: Highest accuracy seems to be around k=40, but players usually prefer ratings to be a bit more dynamic. I'd rather go with something higher even if accuracy is slightly worse (e.g. k=64).
